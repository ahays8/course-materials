Description:
PortScanner(lo int, hi int, verbose bool) (numberOpen int, numberClosed int, portsList map[int]bool)
This code scans a range of ports between lo and hi.
It prints the statuses of these ports to the console if verbose is set to true, otherwise it prints nothing.
It returns the number of open ports, the number of closed ports, and a map of ports.
This map stores the number of each port, as well as its status in the form of a boolean.
True means that the port is open, false means that the port is closed.

Modifications:
* added usage line
* tracks closed ports
* changed Dial to DialTimeout
* added commas to console output
* returns numberClosed
* returns portsList
* searches user specified range
* option to turn off printing list of ports to console
* modified and/or added the following tests

Tests:
TestOpenPort15to30: tests number of open ports 15 to 30, should return 1

TestTotalPortsScanned15to30: tests number of ports 15 to 30, should return 15

TestPortOpen15to30: tests status of port 22, should return true

TestPortClosed15to30: tests status of port 5, should return false

TestOpenPort0to1024: tests number of open ports 0 to 1024, should return 1
(port 80 hasn't been open for me lately)

TestTotalPortsScanned0to1024: tests number of ports 0 to 1024, should return 1024
